# Z_2breaking




Comments on Carena et.al. 

0. FOPTs can be found in MSbar, none in the on-shell scheme, why??
1. Nothing strange seems to happen at mh=ms
2. Their figures seem to correspond to lower renormalization scale
3. Why do they cut the ranges of the figures significantly?
4. Agreed that their eqn. (3.6) controls the strength of the FOPT
5. lambda effective bounded from above??

Spontaneous Z_2 breaking model (done carefully)

0. Choose renormalization
1. Brute force scan
2. Select points with alpha>0.001 (strong PT don’t hide)
3. Plot alpha vs all parameters of the model to find possible correlations

0. Transitions exist at mh=ms but are very weak in this region
1. Stronger transitions for mu=v than for  mu=1TeV
2. Strongest transitions tend to appear for conformal limit  !!!
