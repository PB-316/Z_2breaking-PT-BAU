# Phase transitions, GW and EW baryogenesis in the simplest scalar extension of the SM

Implementation of the scalar singlet model without Z2 symmetry. Code used for scanning parameter space and finding first order phase transitions. 
Many Jupyter notebooks with data visualisation and analysis of the output.
